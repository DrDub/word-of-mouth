<!-- A collection of documents annotated with entites.

A valid document looks something like this:

<docs>
  <doc id="https://example.com/1"><band id="Q16839267">Glass Animals</band> is an amazing band.</doc>
  ...
</docs>

This schema is still an early attempt. Some things that should be revisited:

- Ids are currently optional. I am not sure it is the best way to go.
- We create one element per entity type (but share a common
type). This makes the schema specific but high touch as we add new
type of entities. Maybe we should have a generic type for all
entities.

One limitation of this schema is that entities can't partially overlap
because of how xml works. Entities need to be parent, child or
disjoint among each others. It shouldn't be an issue for gold dataset,
it could be an issue for machine produced data where more than the
best hypothesis is outputted.
